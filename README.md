# Climate-Change-Vs-Religion

There are three plots in the analysis, on a 2*2 grid. The first and third plots are intended to give a geographical visualization of the variables (percentage of respondents opposed to prioritizing the environment over the economy) and (number of adherents of evangelical christianity per thousand residents). The second plot is a scatter, of these two variables, with each point representing a county. From the geo plots we can see that evangelical christianity is particularly popular in certain regions of the United states, particularly the south east. Opposition to giving priority to the environment is however more dispersed geographically. though the south east states show heavy opposition too. From the scatter, we can see that, though low and high rates of opposition to prioritizing the environment is found across all counties, counties with higher evangelical christian adherents only show high rates of opposition. This is a nuance uncovered by the analysis, opposition to environmentalism comes from those with other beliefs as well, though there is scarce support for environmentalism in counties with a high rate of evangelical christianity adherents. Note: a few counties have more than thousand adherents per 1000 residents, among other reasons this could be because of a large city situated at a county boundary, where residents of the city cross the boundary to worship.
